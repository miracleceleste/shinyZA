# ✨ Update: Manual Pokédex Entry Feature

## What's New

You can now add Pokémon to your Pokédex **without hunting them!**

## Why This Matters

Some Pokémon can't be caught in the wild:
- **Evolutions** - Bayleef, Meganium, Ivysaur, etc.
- **Already owned** - Shinies you caught before using the tracker
- **Trades** - Shinies received from friends
- **Events** - Special distribution Pokémon

Now you can track your **complete shiny living dex** including these!

## How It Works

### For Uncaught Pokémon:

1. Go to **Pokédex** tab
2. Look for the **✚ icon** on uncaught entries
3. **Click any Pokémon** (even ones showing "?")
4. Fill in the form:
   - How did you get it? (Evolved, Already Caught, Traded, Gift)
   - Gender
   - Current level
   - Alpha status
   - Notes
5. **Add to Pokédex** - Done!

### For Already Caught Pokémon:

1. Click a **caught entry** (gold ones)
2. View all your catches of that Pokémon
3. Click **"+ Add Another Entry"** at the bottom
4. Add another shiny of the same species!

## Visual Indicators

**Uncaught Entries:**
- White background
- "?" sprite
- **✚ icon** in top-right corner
- Hover shows green plus

**Caught Entries:**
- Gold gradient background
- Shiny sprite visible
- **✓ icon** in top-right corner

## Entry Types

When viewing Pokédex details, entries are marked:

**🎯 Hunted** - Caught through active hunting
- Shows: Zone, encounters, odds, method, phase status

**📝 Manual Entry** - Added manually
- Shows: How obtained (Evolved, Traded, etc.)

Both types show: Date, gender, level, alpha status, notes

## Perfect For

✅ **Evolution Lines**
- Evolve your Chikorita → Add Bayleef & Meganium manually

✅ **Living Dex**
- Track one of each shiny, even if you didn't hunt them all

✅ **Pre-Tracker Catches**
- Add shinies you caught before using the tracker

✅ **Trades & Gifts**
- Include shinies from friends or events

✅ **Completion Tracking**
- See your true shiny collection, not just hunted ones

## Example Use Cases

**Scenario 1: Evolution**
- Hunt and catch shiny Chikorita
- Evolve it to Bayleef (level 16)
- Go to Pokédex → Click Bayleef → Select "Evolved"
- Fill in level 16, add note "From my Chikorita hunt"
- Evolve to Meganium → Repeat!

**Scenario 2: Old Saves**
- You have 10 shinies from before the tracker existed
- Go through Pokédex clicking each one
- Select "Already Caught"
- Add them all to your collection

**Scenario 3: Trading**
- Friend gives you shiny Dratini
- Click Dratini in Pokédex
- Select "Traded"
- Add note "From [friend's name]"

## Tips

💡 **Click Everything!** Every Pokédex entry is clickable now

💡 **Use Notes** - Remember where each shiny came from

💡 **Multiple Entries** - Can have both hunted AND manual entries for same Pokémon

💡 **Living Dex** - Perfect for tracking one of each evolution stage

💡 **No Limits** - Add as many entries as you want per Pokémon

## Differences: Hunted vs Manual

| Feature | Hunted Entry 🎯 | Manual Entry 📝 |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| Zone | ✅ | ❌ |
| Encounters | ✅ | ❌ |
| Odds | ✅ | ❌ |
| Method | ✅ | ❌ |
| Phase | ✅ | ❌ |
| Obtain Method | ❌ | ✅ (Evolved/Traded/etc) |
| Date | ✅ | ✅ |
| Gender | ✅ | ✅ |
| Level | ✅ | ✅ |
| Alpha | ✅ | ✅ |
| Notes | ✅ | ✅ |

## Data Safety

- Manual entries are stored locally like hunted catches
- Export/Import works with both types
- Entries are clearly marked so you know which is which
- Can't accidentally lose your manual entries

## Future Ideas

Some possible additions based on this feature:
- Living Dex checklist view
- Filter by entry type (hunted/manual)
- Statistics on manual vs hunted
- Form variations tracking

---

**Bottom Line:** Your Pokédex is now a true shiny collection tracker, not just a hunt log! 

Add everything you've caught, traded, or evolved to see your complete shiny journey! ✨
